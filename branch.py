def git_branch():
    '''
    Git branch is used to create a new branch.
    Commands used are : `git branch <branch name>`
                        `git checkout -b <branch name>`
    
    Note: 1. When you use git branch , it just creates a branch.
             So, you have to use `git switch` or `git checkout <branch name>` to go to that branch.
          2. But, When you use `git checkout -b`, it will automatically switched to the new branch.
